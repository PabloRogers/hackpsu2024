# Pathfinder üß≠

Pathfinder is an AI-powered platform that combines career guidance with advanced document summarization capabilities. It aims to provide accurate and reliable information to users, leveraging the power of AI without compromising on data integrity.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

Pathfinder was born from the concept of an "Advisor at Your Hands." Our goal was to create an AI chatbot that offers:

- Accurate and reliable career guidance
- Promotion of Penn State Smeal College of Business programs
- Trustworthy information processing without "hallucination"

## ü§ñ What it does

Pathfinder offers two key functionalities:

1. **Career Guidance Chatbot**: 
   - Explores different career paths
   - Provides personalized advice
   - Offers insights based on individual interests and skills
   - Promotes Penn State Smeal programs

2. **RAG Bot for ICDS**: 
   - Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation
   - Summarizes complex documents
   - Provides accurate responses based on user guides or documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

- Frontend: Next.js for a dynamic and user-friendly interface
- Backend: Langchain for sophisticated natural language processing and RAG capabilities
- Data Pipelines:
  - Career Advisor: Pulls data from curated internet sources and Smeal program details
